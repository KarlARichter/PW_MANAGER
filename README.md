Python password manager using AES-256 encryption with the cryptography library and bcrypt for secure storage and master password management.

1. Utilizes hashed and salted verification for secure authentication with an option to change the master password.

2. Supports custom generation of strong passwords with length validation and security checks using the zxcvbn library for strength analysis and feedback.

3. Safely encrypts and decrypts passwords for storage and retrieval.

4. CRUD Operations allows users to create, view, update, and delete encrypted passwords associated with account names.

5. Audit logging tracks user actions (e.g., adding, viewing, deleting passwords, login attempts) in a timestamped audit.log file for accountability.

6. Log management features to clear the audit log and rotate log files when they exceed a size threshold for efficient storage management.

7. Password strength validation rejects weak passwords based on a minimum threshold for strength, providing warnings and actionable feedback for improvement.

8. Secure access controls tracks login success, failures, and access denial attempts to ensure secure usage.
