This project implements a basic password manager using Python, utilizing the cryptography library for encryption and decryption of passwords. It allows users to add, view, and delete passwords, with each password securely stored in an encrypted format within a file. The encryption key is generated and stored locally, or loaded if it already exists. Users can either input their own password or generate a secure one. The program checks that each generated password includes at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character, regenerating the password if it doesn't meet these criteria.
